<title>On YAML Discussions - Earthly Blog</title>
<meta name="description" content="My article about how YAML makes a bad programming language 1 generated a lot of great discussions online.

You’ve only made it harder to onboard new programmers to the project.   Reason: Hope that if certain logic is encoded in config files, then it can never get complicated.   Reality check: Product requirements do not magically become simpler because of your implementation decisions.   Reason: Hope that you can get non-programmers to code review your business logic.

<p>This is an excellent point. <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl">HCL</a> does look a bit less strange to outsiders, and HashiCorp already has mind share in the DevOps community, and it certainly beats config templates.</p>
<h2 id="dsl-creation-story">DSL Creation Story</h2>
<p>reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ls6tgm/intercal_yaml_and_other_horrible_programming/gopf8fj/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">XANi_</a> explained how DSL’s embedded in YAML keep getting created: &gt; The vicious cycle of &gt; &gt; * We don’t want config to be Turing complete, we just need to declare some initial setup &gt; &gt; * Oops, we need to add some conditions. Just code it as data, changing config format is too much work &gt; &gt; * Oops, we need to add some templates. Just use &lt;primary language’s popular templating library&gt;, changing config format is too much work. &gt; &gt; * And congratulations, you have now written a DSL &gt; &gt;If you need conditions and flexibility, picking existing language is by FAR superior choice.</p>

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->
<p>Many readers pointed out that their development community skipped right by this DSL dead end by using a full programming language for build and config needs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I always thought it was weird that a lot of web technologies take config files that are executable JavaScript. (Thinking of webpack). But it makes a lot of sense now, and I much prefer that approach. - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ls6tgm/intercal_yaml_and_other_horrible_programming/gopq0uv/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Bunny</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s fairly common in Pythonland [ to just use Python] …</p>
<p>It’s an ideal solution for technically-savvy users in non-security sensitive contexts. - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ls6tgm/intercal_yaml_and_other_horrible_programming/gopy30z/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"><strong>crakers</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not convinced that just using programming language for your configuration files is actually that bad. For instance, with node, if you just use JS files that export an object instead of. JSON files, you end up with a lot more programmable and flexible thing. I don’t actually see the problem. - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ls6tgm/intercal_yaml_and_other_horrible_programming/goqm3z0/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">light24bulbs</a></p>

<h2 id="writing-a-parser">Writing a Parser</h2>
<p>Hillel Wayne wrote a <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/a3fe2688-464d-4f98-ae6b-207e7b5a1255">great newsletter</a> on YAML, and the ways it’s abused. He pointed out that the main competition for embedding your DSL into YAML is writing a parser, and using YAML is just easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[YAML] pre-parses the content for us. This isn’t a big enough draw to YAMLize complex programming languages, but it’s a huge deal for small DSLs. I suspect that’s the main reason why semgrep uses YAML for its rules and why so many technologies jury-rig it into a configuration language</p>
